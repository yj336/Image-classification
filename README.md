# Image-classification
The purpose of this project is to seperage large man-made outdoor things [bridge, castle, house, road, skyscraper] from large natural outdoor scenes [cloud, forest, mountain, plain, sea] using Cifar 100 dataset with subclass from each of the superclass deleted. 

Different machine learning models will be used and then different feature extractions will be used in training and testing, includes:
Logistic Regression
Ensemble Methods: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Extra Trees
SVM
DenseNet
